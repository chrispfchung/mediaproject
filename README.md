# Media Project end of Module 1


## CSVs included
We have sent API calls to themoviedb.org and retrieved data on nearly 6000 movies. Data points include, movie title, revenue, budget, genre, and more.
In addition, we scraped IMDB for academy award winning movies sorted by box office revenue. Unfortunatly, the code broke after page 2, we only retrieved 500 data points. These movies datapoints also have directors and actors.


### Approach

###
-Estimate required budget.
-Genres to invest in.
-Which directors to hire?
-Which movie stars do we want?
-Estimate good movie length
-Best month to release film (highest gross revenue)


When thinking about how much our budget should be, we looked into which genres have a low barrier entry point. 
Horror and Western popped out to have significantly lower budgets. Surprisingly, these genres have also performered extremely well from ROI perspective. This is to say, not only is it cheap to produce these movies, they also, on average, produce higher profits.
